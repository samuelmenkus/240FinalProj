Chat log


S~ so now we need to make it work?
A~ I suppose?
S~ What does CLion say is wrong with it?
A~ Right now I'm on my PC, so gimme a sec to get Clion up and running.
S~ K.
A~ Nice chat log btw, haha.
S~ I know right.
A~ Alright, I'm going to copy the new code over and run it, and see what I get.
S~ K.
S~ It says that we possibly lost 144 bytes
A~ Lovely. Any ideas where we're losing it?
S~ not really
A~ Well that's rather problematic
S~ Probably world.cpp and the human vector
A~ Hm...
S~ Like the same place we where having problems yesterday
S~ i think i figured it out. In the default Constructor you need to push the
        new humans onto the vector. Not just at the vector spot
A~ Want me to try and run it now?
S~ yeah. It should sort of work
A~ WE GOT SOMETHING!!!! Check Discord
S~ I did it with only 172 errors
A~ Oh dear
A~ Any idea what's causing the issue here?
S~ try to run it again
A~ What files should I update/what did you change?
S~ world.cpp <- That should be it
S~ try again still just world.cpp
S~ try running it. world.h and world.cpp is what i updated
        I think it works now.
A~
S~
